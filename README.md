# Data Science project
## Wine quality prediction:
Our main objective is to predict the quality of wine using machine learning through Python programming technique. A large dataset is considered and wine quality is modelled to through different parameters like fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, pH etc. In this project all these parameters were analysed through
Machine learning algorithms which helped us to rate the scale of wine from 1 to 10 or bad to good. Output obtained was further checked for correctness and model was optimised accordingly. It can support the wine expert evaluations and ultimately improve the production.
