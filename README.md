# Data Science project
Wine quality prediction:
Our main objective is to predict the quality of wine udsing machine learning thriugh Python programming technique. A ;arge dataset is considered and wine quality is modelled to analyse the quality of wine through different parameters like fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, pH etc. In this project all these parameters were analysed through
Machine learning algorithms which helped us to rate the scale of wone from 1 to 10 or bad to good. Output obtained was further checked for correctness and model was optimised accordingly. It can supportt he wine expert evaluations and ultimately improve the production.
